This repo contains my personal blog, which you can find at the link above.

The remainder of this README contains notes to my future self, so that I can
stop forgetting how to do everything in the long intervals between posts. Read
on if that's your thing, weirdo.

### Run local server

+ `bundle exec jekyll serve`
+ enjoy at localhost:4000

### Add a new post

+ create new file in `_posts` folder named as `YYYY-MM-DD-any-name-you-like.md` as a copy of `_posts/template.md`
+ edit the header to set `published: true`
+ when you run the local server, then new post will be there, edit and enjoy
