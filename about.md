# About me

I am Keith Ma, your friendly neighborhood research scientist and software
developer. I currently work in applied machine learning at [Boston Fusion Corp]({{ page.url-bfc }}),
and am working towards completing my PhD at in [Geology & Geophysics at Yale University]({{ page.url-yale-geo }}).

I am always happy to talk - so please feel free to reach out.

# About this blog

This blog is intended as a place to share things that I think are worth sharing
in an informal setting. The site is just starting out, but I expect it to
include my own work and discussions of other's work that I found interesting
and useful. Suggestions are most welcome.

# About the name 

NaN means "not a number", which is often what you get when something goes
horribly wrong in your code. As any scientific programmer will know, it is all
to common to excitedly print the output of some long-running simulation only to
find ... **it's all damn NaNs!** Hopefully this blog can help someone,
somewhere, sometime do more science and get less NaNs.
